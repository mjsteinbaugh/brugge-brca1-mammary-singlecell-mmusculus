# zingeR-edgeR
#
# We first perform a differential expression analysis using zingeR posterior
# probabilities and focussing on the count component of the ZINB model. We use
# edgeR to model the count component.
#
# The weights are estimated with the core function of zingeR, zeroWeightsLS. It
# is important to be consistent with the normalization procedure, i.e. if you
# use TMM normalization for the analysis, you should also use it for estimating
# the zingeR posterior probabilities. In a next section, we demonstrate a
# zero-inflated NB analysis using DESeq2 where we re-estimate the weights using
# the proper DESeq2 normalization. The user can also input normalization factors
# from any normalization procedure of interest by using the normFactors argument
# in zeroWeightsLS.
#
# The weights can then be provided in the DGEList object which will be used for
# dispersion estimation in the native edgeR estimateDisp function.
#
# After estimation of the dispersions and zingeR posterior probabilities, the
# glmWeightedF function is used for statistical inference. This is an adapted
# function from the glmLRT function of edgeR. It uses an F-test for which the
# denominator degrees of freedom are by default adjusted according to the
# downweighting of excess zeros (argument ZI=TRUE). Also, independent filtering
# can be performed on the obtained p-values (argument
# independentFiltering=TRUE). We use the independent filtering strategy that was
# originally implemented in DESeq2. By default, the average fitted values are
# used as a filter criterion.
