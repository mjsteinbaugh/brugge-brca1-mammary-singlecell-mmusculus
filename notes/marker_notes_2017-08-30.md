Promiscuous known markers (remove?):
- Bst2
- Cd63
- Sfn
- Tspan13
- Vim

# B cells
Seem to be specific to cluster 13

# Basophils
Basophil genes have very weak, not specific expression. Can't identify clearly.

# Dendritic cells (conventional)
Seem to be specific to cluster 10?
Cd209a, Cd83, Itgax
Carman didn't label these in the last update

# Dendritic cells (plasmacytoid)
Nothing clear here

# Endothelial cells
Looks like 2, 7, 16
Cdh5, Cldn5, Kdr, Pecam1, Rassip1

# Eosinophils
Nothing clear here -- all the markers bleed, or are weak

# Erythrocytes
1, 3, 6, 9
11?

# Luminal progenitors
Cd14, Elf5, Kit
1, 8, 9

# Mature luminal cell
Epcam: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11
Krt18: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
8, 9, 1, 3, 6

# Myofibroblast
Pretty clear specificity to 11

# Natural killer cells
Unclear

# T Cell
4, 13, 15, 16
